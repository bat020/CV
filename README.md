## Anindya Bhattacharyya

I'm a writer and coder based in London. I've spent most of the past 20 years working as a journalist, editor and campaigner – but I'm now shifting into software development. I have a good head for abstract problem solving and strong communications skills. I learn fast, and enjoy learning fast. I'm looking for a junior developer role where I can deploy all these abilities to do something useful.

## Skills

#### Coding

I've built a Chrome extension called Accent Grid that has 12,000 users worldwide (according to Google Play). It gives users easy access to accented and special characters from within the Google Chrome browser.

I searched for a neat tool to help me type accents, but couldn't find one. So taught myself JavaScript from scratch and
built the extension myself. See [bat020.tumblr.com/accent-grid](http://bat020.tumblr.com/accent-grid) for more details or check out the code on [github](https://github.com/bat020/accent-grid).

I enjoyed writing this extension so much I decided to switch from journalism to software development. I've just completed an intensive coding course at Makers Academy which introduced me to Ruby, test driven development, Rails and AngularJS. My final project at Makers was Alarming, a "social alarm clock" phone app that sends out coordinated alarms for meetings and events.

#### Communications

I have a great deal of experience in all aspects of communication – public speaking, writing, design, social media – that I've picked up in my 20 years as a journalist and editor covering all manner of topics. It's a skill that transfers easily to dealing with user interface aspects of coding, as well as being useful in a general business environment.

#### Concepts

My degree was in pure mathematics and I recently completed an MA in modern European philosophy. I have a good head for abstract concepts and a talent for explaining them. You can find examples of my essays and articles on my blog at [bat020.com](http://bat020.com), or watch a recent talk I gave on maths and philosophy at [youtu.be/mPu_FLlxWoU](https://youtu.be/mPu_FLlxWoU). I can solve a Rubik's Cube in under a minute.
