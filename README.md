## Anindya Bhattacharyya

I'm a writer and coder based in London. I've spent the past 20 years working as a journalist, editor and campaigner but am now switching to software development. I have a good head for problem solving and strong communications skills. I learn fast, and enjoy learning fast. I'm looking for a junior developer role where I can deploy these abilities to do something useful.

## Skills

#### Coding

I've built a Chrome extension called [**Accent Grid**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accent-grid/efedjomeallaomheefphgnbleieplnfk?hl=en-GB) that has 9,000 users worldwide (according to Google Play). It provides easy access to accented and special characters from within the Chrome browser. I was searching for a tool to do this, but couldn't find one – so I taught myself **JavaScript** and built it myself. See [bat020.tumblr.com/accent-grid](http://bat020.tumblr.com/accent-grid) for more details or check out the code on [github.com/bat020/accent-grid](https://github.com/bat020/accent-grid).

I've just completed an intensive coding course at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) which introduced me to **Ruby**, test driven development, Rails and AngularJS. My final project at Makers was [**Alarming**](https://github.com/hvenables/alarming), a "social alarm clock" phone app that sends out coordinated alarms for meetings and events.

[**Knight Chase**](http://bat020.github.io/knight-chase/) is a fun toy I wrote at Makers with a colleague. It's a single page application written in pure JavaScript and jQuery that implements an unusual and intriguing two player strategy game.

I also have experience working in **LISP**, **Prolog** and a variety of traditional languages such as **C** and **Fortran**. I'm currently teaching myself **Haskell** and **C#**.

#### Communications

I have a great deal of experience in all aspects of communication – public speaking, writing, design, social media – that I've picked up in my 20 years as a journalist and editor covering all manner of topics. It's a skill that transfers easily to dealing with user interface aspects of coding, as well as being useful in a general business environment.

In my time as a journalist I've launched a magazine on financial risk management, edited newsletters, managed teams, put a national newspaper online every night, and reported on Occupy Wall Street.

#### Concepts

My degree was in **pure mathematics** and I recently completed an MA in modern European **philosophy**. I have a talent for explaining abstract concepts: check out my essays and articles at [bat020.com](http://bat020.com), or watch a recent talk I gave on maths and philosophy at [youtu.be/mPu_FLlxWoU](https://youtu.be/mPu_FLlxWoU). I can solve a **Rubik's Cube** in under a minute, using an algorithm I developed myself.
